## Low Code
### Essence —— Cost reduction and efficiency increase
1. Reduce development costs
=> a. Mandatory unified component library reuse b. Improve system consistency c. Reduce investment in development resources
=>
a. Establishment of material piles (direct connection, integration)
Type:
el-form el-form-item
el-input
zw-form-input
Features:
Business decoupling, non-aware hot loading

b. System consistency specification (interaction, UI, logic) - atomic design

c. Development input process

2. Traditional configuration platform
Dreamweaver, xcode, IDE - Skeleton-oriented configuration tools
=> no-code, but more focused on layout

3. no-code & low-code - mixed, low-code, no-code
no-code: pages with rich layout and light logic
low-code: heavy logic —— configuration-based, code as logical supplement
